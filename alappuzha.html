      Places to visit in Alleppey: Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary, Vembanad Lake, Mannarasala Temple, Ambalapuzha Temple, St. Andrew's Forane Church, Pathiramanal, Pandavan Rock, Edathua Church, etc.
      There is a diversity among the many places to visit in Alleppey, from the rewarding sight of the sea to the wriggling inlets of backwaters and jungle streams- No wonder Alleppey was called the “Venice of the east” by Lord Curzon. The concept of houseboats which is locally called Kettuvallam in Malayalam is a primitive practice in Kerala. 
      Located around 53 kilometers from Cochin, the town is celebrated for its backwaters which connect Cochin and Kumarakom to the North. Besides backwaters and the sea, Alleppey is also famous for its ageless temples, serpentine canals draining into the ocean, colorful lagoons, rice paddies, and a 150-year old lighthouse.  While you are soaking up the laid-back coastal bliss, do try to visit the famous Andhakaranazhi Beach- the beauty gets amplified during sunset hours.

Thus, it is one of the best places to see in Alleppey. It is also quite famous as a picnic spot. The route to the caves is easy but elder people should avoid the trail, in case they suffer from health problems. The rock caves are adjoined by the Kallada Dam, which is a tourist attraction as well.

                  Pathiramanal, which means “Sands of the Night”, is a small lake island located on the backwaters of Alappuzha in Lake Vembanad. It is a bird watcher’s paradise since it is supposed to hold approximately 91 local species of birds and 50 species of migratory birds. The location of the island is extremely scenic, making it a lovely space to observe birds and the water.
                  The ride across Lake Vembanad is lovely as is the experience of walking through the island. If you happen to visit in the right season, you will find yourself surrounded by the chirpy sounds of thousands of birds. This certainly makes for one of the places to visit in Alleppey.

                  This is one of the most beautiful Alappuzha tourist places that you absolutely cannot miss. Vembanad Lake is Kerala’s longest lake and is also among the largest in India. Several canals empty their water into the lake at several points along its wide expanse. Since it is a long lake, it covers many districts of Kerala and goes by different names in each district like Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. Many small islands dot its length. 

Boating in this lake is a part of backwater trip in Kerala. The Kumarakom Tourist Village offers houseboat cruises and holiday packages which you can take advantage of and so have the best possible backwater boating experience on your trip.
